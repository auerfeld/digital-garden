Here's some random text that I need to work on. 
# What I want to do with this site

In 2023-24 I'm very lucky to be one of the inaugural research fellows at the [Disruption Network Institute](https://www.disruptionlab.org/institute). 

I'll be reading, thinking (and eventually writing and talking) about Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) and in particular the UK Government's position on these. 

I'm using Obsidian to organise much of this research. This site will show some of my work in progress. 

Initially, I aim to publish a timeline and bibliography here before the end of 2023. We'll see how that goes.
